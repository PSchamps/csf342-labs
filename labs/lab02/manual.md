# CS F342 – Lab 2
## Sequential Verilog Foundations

This lab introduces state, time, and control in digital systems using Verilog.

---

## Task 1: D Flip-Flop with Reset (Starter)
Students begin from the provided DFF and add synchronous and asynchronous reset.

## Task 2: Register (Structural)
Build a multi-bit register using DFFs from Task 1.

## Task 3: Shift Register
Compare blocking vs non-blocking assignments. Incorrect designs will fail waveform inspection.

## Task 4: Counter
Design an up-counter with reset.

## Task 5 (Homework): FSM with ROM-style Control
See course handout for full specification.
